In this repository we're developing the website of the [Royal Rangers](https://royal-rangers.de) Outpost 104 Kiel (Germany).  

This is a didactic project for our teenage members. 

You can see the current development version of the homepage at: https://rr104.github.io/royal-rangers-kiel.de

### Maintenance procedures

#### Update team list

1. Edit the teams and leaders table [teams_and_leaders.csv](https://github.com/RR104/royal-rangers-kiel.de/blob/master/data/teams_and_leaders.csv) according to the new situation. The table structure has to remain the same, but teams can be edited, removed and added as necessary.

2. Commit (and push) your changes. Everything else should get handled automatically by the javascript code that creates this display element.
